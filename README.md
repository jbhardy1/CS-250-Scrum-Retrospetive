# CS-250-Scrum-Retrospetive
This repository pulls together the agile and Scrum practices that I've learned and applied throughout my time in SNHU's CS-250 course.

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interpreting user needs is always going to be something that isn't done perfectly. However, in order to implement what they want to the best of my ability, communication will always be key. Asking follow up or clarifying questions will allow me to hone in on what exactly the user wants and will go a long way in ensuring that the correct features are being implemented. User stories will play a huge role in this as they set the base line as to what it is the user wants to see.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   I always approach developing by breaking down what the program should do into smaller parts. I usually start withing psuedocode or a flowchart as it allows me to vizualise what the program needs to be done; then I'll sort the features into groups based on difficulty and the amount of time it will take to do so. Recently I've started doing more and more collaborative work with other students and hope to emphasise the importance of planning and testing to ensure that whatever we work on together is done so efficiently.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team member means many things. To me, a good team member is responsible, devoted, helpful, and holds themselves accountable. Having a team member that is inherently selfish and doesn't contribute to the rest of the team is always going to hinder the team and in turn, the product. By being an open and friendly face in the group that takes care of their portion, and maybe even more outside of their work load, the overall success of the team will always be phenomenal.
